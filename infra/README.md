# Chef Infra

Chef Infra is the bread and butter of Chef. 99% of our customers are using Chef Infra in one way or another to manage their fleet of servers from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of systems.

The active products that used in Chef Infra are:

- [Chef Infra Client](./client.md)
- [Chef Infra Server (standalone)](./server.md)
- [Chef Infra Server (habitized - installed via Automate)](./server.md)
- [Chef Backend](./backend.md)

I'm going to dig into these products to try and explain some core concepts, impart some useful wisdom, and answer questions where possible.
